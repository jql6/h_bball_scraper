# Hashtag Basketball League Scouting Report Scraper

A Python script that automatically scrapes Hashtag Basketball's League Scouting Report into a csv file. You can then visualize this data to get an idea of what your team's strengths and weaknesses are compared to other teams in your league.

Credits to [SebaLG](https://github.com/SebaLG/) for making the `amazon-bot.py` file which I modified to scrape Hashtag Basketball's data. You can find it here: https://github.com/SebaLG/amazon-python-bot
